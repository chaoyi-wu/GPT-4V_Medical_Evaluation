# GPT-4V_Medical_Evaluation
The official image collection basis for "Can GPT-4V(ision) Serve Medical Applications? Case Studies on GPT-4V for Multimodal Medical Diagnosis"

[ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09909)

In this paper, we systematically show different cases to answer the question "Can GPT-4V(ision) Serve Medical Applications?" and in this project, you can find the original images we used in our paper. We test GPT-4V form **17** commonly seen medical systems and cover **8** different imageing modalities as shown in the following figure.

## Project Organization:
We organize the cases following systems, demonstrated as fowllowing: 
```
├── GPT-4V_Eval 
│ ├── System1 
│ │ ├── case_1 
│ │ │ └── 1.png 
│ │ │ └── 2.png 
│ │ │ ... 
│ │ └── case_2 
| | ... 
│ └── System2 
| ... 
```

## Acknowledgement
We sincerely thank the radiologists who upload cases on Radiopaedia for their spirit of sharing.
